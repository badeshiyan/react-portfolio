# react-portfolio

## Overview:

For this unit, we continued our efforts with react. We put our react skills to the test by creating an updated online portfolio. While the portfolio includes the same features as our previous one, we are now able to showcase our knowledge of some of the lastest software development technologies.

Below, please find additional information regarding my new portfolio. Thanks.
